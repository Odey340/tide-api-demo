This is a simple tide lookup web app built with **FastAPI** for the backend and a **responsive, animated HTML/CSS/JS frontend**.

Users can enter a city and an API key to fetch real-time tide data from NOAA. Results are displayed in a clean, modern interface with tide type, time, and height in feet/meters.

Use the demo API key: `Verne`
